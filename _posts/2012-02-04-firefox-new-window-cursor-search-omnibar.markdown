I am using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/omnibar/">Omnibar</a> extension in Firefox which gives Firefox a Chrome like search/address/location bar. When I open a new window I want the cursor position to default to this bar. In order to do this, in Firefox I set the default hompage to blank, and when I did that, the cursor was put in the Omnibar instead of on the homepage which was loading
