I was fiddling with MPD and MPDroid today and had some issues. My MPD could stream from my laptop to my phone/MPDroid fine using the lame encoder (which started being pre-packaged in Ubuntu 11.04) but I was not able to do so from my home server. The difference? ubuntu-restricted-extras. I loaded ubuntu-restricted-extras onto my server and fixed the issue. Unfortunately I have killed an ant with a nuke because I got a whole bunch of non-needed packages in the process, but, oh well. School is starting soon, and it got the job done. I have yet to be able to stream to Chromium however.
