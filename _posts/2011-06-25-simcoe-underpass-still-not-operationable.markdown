Over a year ago I took <a href="http://www.torypages.com/blog/?p=162">these</a> photos of the bikelane on Simcoe. These photos actually led to an <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/778222--anger-as-cars-clog-new-simcoe-st-bike-lane">article</a> in the Toronto Star (however I did not receive credit). It was also picked up on <a href="http://bikingtoronto.com/duncan/lower-simcoe-taxi-stand-wait-thats-a-bike-lane/">Duncan's City Ride</a> over at <a href="http://www.bikingtoronto.com">Biking Toronto</a>. Today I happened to be in the area and figured to make sure I have a safe passage under the rail lines I'd take the Simcoe bike lane! Buuuut....

On the West side North of the underpass I found:

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1aipszg3yytruj7/DSC00286.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ofaf0phkjtgn038/DSC00286-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Bikelane Closed" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-870" /></a>

South West side:

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/78e22m6r2f8ibsi/DSC00291-e1309038321230.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/x2jsj3knsslnsc8/DSC00291-e1309038321230-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="Bikelane Closed" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-868" /></a>

South East side:

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2s6hglth75s0efr/DSC00287.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/r0qcvjq4m888n0b/DSC00287-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Van in Bikelane" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-869" /></a>

Then since I had my camera out I found this between Lakeshore and Queens Quay:

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/nq016vdspz9k78i/DSC00297.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qelnnpcb4z6vagi/DSC00297-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Taxie in Bikelane" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-866" /></a>

Buuuut, that wasn't enough, I encountered two more before I got to the safety of the Martin Goodman Trail:

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/yjanql21jlg4uq8/DSC00298.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5s10pvdvj8v80ic/DSC00298-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="SUV in Biklane" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-865" /></a>

<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/j7pvy4d6cplti5b/DSC00299.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/dvstvbefvjhnkst/DSC00299-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Taxie in Biklane" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-864" /></a>

I don't have much to say, I noticed the water coming out from both sides of the underpass, I guess there may have been something legitimately wrong, but I seem to have bad luck with this underpass or it is neglected. I used to take a lot of pictures of cars in bikelanes, I gave up because it was extending my commute time by too much.
