I like having a really fast mouse speed. I wanted to set the speed faster than the maximum allowed speed in Ubuntu 10.04. This is how I did it.
{% highlight bash %}$ xset m 5 1{% endhighlight %}
I'm sure you can configure this more to your liking, but this was good enough for me. Check the manual page if interested of course.
