I'm currently attempting to read a DRM protected eBook for school. I found the font to be too small, but, sucks to be me because the publisher has not enabled the zoom function on the book, and they wonder why people pirate. With a regular PDF you would be able to do things as simple as zooming in on the page. Not to mention the fact that I have to load up an entire virtual machine just to read the book since the DRM is not compatible with Linux but only OSX and Windows.
