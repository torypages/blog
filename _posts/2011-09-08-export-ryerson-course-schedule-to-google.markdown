I consider this to be alpha quality at the moment because testing is <del>limited</del> non-existent except for the one case displayed in this video. But, I'm busy and don't have time to perfect it. If used as intended this could be a useful script, it was for me.

The script is located here <a href="http://torypages.com/scripts/ryersonToIcs/index.py">http://torypages.com/scripts/ryersonToIcs/index.py</a>. This was however also tested with Thunderbird/Lightning and at a glance seemed to work.
